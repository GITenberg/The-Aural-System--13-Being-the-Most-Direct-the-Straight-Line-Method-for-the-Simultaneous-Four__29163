3</span>Some time ago, a Mr. Wm. Rodger came down from Glasgow
for the purpose of showing how foreign languages should be
taught.&nbsp; He brought on a gentleman, a clergyman from Leeds,
who had gone through Otto&rsquo;s German Grammar without being
able either to speak or understand German; this gentleman was
able to bear testimony to the merit of Mr. Rodger&rsquo;s system
because by it he had learnt to do both.&nbsp; Of course his
testimony rested on one assumption.&nbsp; It assumed that having
gone through Otto&rsquo;s Grammar all learnt from it had been
forgotten, and that the whole merit of his success was due to Mr.
Rodger&rsquo;s method.</p>
<p>Mr. Rodger was of opinion, that foreign languages should be
learnt as a child learns its mother tongue.&nbsp; It seemed to me
a strange use to make of the reason and intelligence of the
adult, to cast it aside as useless and to ask the youth and man
to become a child again.&nbsp; It appeared to me the most
wasteful of methods.&nbsp; Is language a science, and if so, what
would be thought of a similar proposal for acquiring any other
science?&nbsp; But are the cases parallel?&nbsp; Is there any
similarity of circumstance?&nbsp; Can the youth and man again
place themselves in the circumstances of the child?</p>
<p>The child is constantly hearing the language spoken, everyone
around it is teaching it to speak, everything around it
stimulates it to do so.&nbsp; Nearly everything it learns, comes
to it through its mother tongue; at play it hears, it
speaks.&nbsp; At five years of age it begins to go to school, and
from that time until its fourteenth or sixteenth year, whatever
else it studies, it must study its mother tongue.&nbsp; All other
knowledge reaches it through this medium.&nbsp; Every other study
compels the study and practice of its mother tongue and allowing
ten hours per day for sleep, by the time it is fourteen years of
age seventy-one thousand six hundred hours have been spent in
such study and practice.</p>
<p>Let us take the case of the youth or man who commences the
study of a foreign language.&nbsp; He has found that a foreign
language will be of use to him or has become necessary to him in
his work.&nbsp; He begins to study it and takes the usual one
lesson per week of one hour&rsquo;s duration.&nbsp; In a year he
has spent fifty hours with the teacher; if he devoted two or
three hours weekly to the preparation of each lesson, he will
have spent 150 to 200 hours per annum upon it, or, less absences
and omissions, perhaps <!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>140 or 180 hours upon its study.&nbsp;
This makes fourteen days of ten hours or perhaps three weeks as
against fourteen years spent by the child upon its mother
tongue.&nbsp; Multiply this amount of fourteen days by two or
three, and grammar is still seen by comparison to have
accomplished a stupendous miracle.&nbsp; But even this disparity
is not complete, for whilst the child, whether at work or play,
never ceases to study and practice its native language, and this
is by far its principal occupation, the youth and man, on the
other hand, devote to the study of a foreign language, the
remnants, the odds and ends of their time, after having exhausted
their energies in their work.</p>
<p>These were the considerations that occurred to me on thinking
over Mr. Rodger&rsquo;s prospectus.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it was
impossible to regard as satisfactory a method of tuition or
study, which left the pupil unable to understand or speak a
language after having gone through a grammar like that of
Otto.&nbsp; The Grammatical Method being one which does not seek
to render easy and simple at the cost of efficiency, by eluding
and evading the difficulties and peculiarities of a language, but
being the one which fairly meets and masters them: there can be
no question of dispensing with its valuable assistance.&nbsp; The
wise course is to adopt that method of using it, which will
enable us to derive most benefit from its teachings, and ensure
success.&nbsp; It is for this purpose the following has been
written.&nbsp; It follows from this, that if the pupil&rsquo;s
time admit, the most complete Grammar is the best.</p>
<p>We have been amongst the most backward in this branch of
study, but our grammars since then have been largely borrowed
from our more successful competitors; from those who excelled as
much in modern languages as we ourselves in industry.&nbsp; They
are in many instances the work of foreign specialists and
experts, they are the very instruments of success used by our
most successful rivals, how then can they be inadequate?&nbsp;
Translation has put us into possession of the best works used by
our foreign rivals, and if we are less successful than they, it
is due, as a Swiss correspondent of the &ldquo;Manchester
Guardian&rdquo; recently stated, not to the superior aptitude,
but to the superior application of the foreigner.</p>
<p>The writer first commenced studying foreign languages nearly
forty years ago, and has resided for nearly twenty years in
various foreign countries.&nbsp; His experience with regard to
those who learn foreign languages has been that those who
commence the practice of a foreign language with a previous
knowledge of <!-- page 5--><a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>its Grammar, learn to speak it with an
ease, confidence and correctness never attained by those who try
to dispense with such preparation and study.&nbsp; On the other
hand those who have learnt to speak without such study, contract
vicious and faulty locutions, and rarely if ever make good the
deficiency.&nbsp; They are compelled of course to form a rough
Grammar of their own, upon incomplete information, and have to do
so hastily and imperfectly.&nbsp; For writing, where precision
and accuracy are required a knowledge not based upon Grammar is
next to worthless.</p>
<p>Most pupils have a fourfold object in studying a language;
they wish to be able to read and write, to speak and to
understand it.&nbsp; By what method could this be most easily
achieved?&nbsp; If this work could be performed simultaneously,
it would effect a saving of time and labour, as well as impress
what was being studied more deeply upon the memory.&nbsp; The
memory for sound, form, music, figures, spelling, etc., appears
to be distinct and to vary in each one.&nbsp; If the memory for
sound could be brought more into play, it must help to retain
more tenaciously what was learnt.</p>
<p>Of course, the pupil can only expect to be master of the
language so far as he has studied and learnt.&nbsp; He cannot
expect to reap where he has not sown.&nbsp; Within this limit he
learns to read, in preparing the lesson, and to write, in writing
out the exercises.</p>
<p>But Mr. Charles Sauer says in the preface to his Italian
Grammar 5th Ed., page iv., &ldquo;Everyone who has occupied
himself with study of modern languages knows, that by far the
more difficult task is to <i>understand</i> the foreign
language,&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i>, when spoken.)</p>
<p>That cannot be called a success which leaves the most
difficult part of the task unaccomplished, nor can it be wise to
allow difficulties to amass and accumulate, if they can be
mastered in detail as they present themselves.&nbsp; The task is
the education of the ear and tongue and this can only be done by
practice.</p>
<p>To learn to understand the language when spoken, one must hear
it spoken; to learn to speak it, one must speak it.&nbsp; It may
even have its advantages if such conversation keep within the
range of the pupil&rsquo;s knowledge.&nbsp; He thus feels that he
ought, must, and can understand, if he try.</p>
<p>If the pupil speak to himself both these results are
attained.&nbsp; This he can do by studying aloud.&nbsp; His
tongue will educate his ear and familiarise it with the new
sounds, whilst the ear will correct the tongue.&nbsp; I assume,
of course, that he is under the <!-- page 6--><a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>guidance of a
teacher; in this case with attention to the teacher&rsquo;s
pronunciation and care, and a little effort on his own part, he
should soon pronounce correctly, easily, and well.&nbsp; By
translating the exercises aloud, from five to twenty times, they
should become as familiar to him as English.&nbsp; But whether
translating into or from English, the foreign sentences should
always be uttered <i>aloud</i> clearly and distinctly.&nbsp; It
is, of course, a drawback, that in this translation aloud and
alone of the exercises, the eye should anticipate the ear in
conveying the words to the brain, but, when full allowance has
been made for this, the gain for the pupil is still immense as
compared with the silent method of study.</p>
<p>The learner should not be satisfied with being able to
translate the exercises, he should aim at being able to use his
new tongue with the same ease, readiness and fluency, as his
native language.&nbsp; At each successive translation, he gains
in this respect whilst engraving his newly acquired knowledge
more deeply on his memory.&nbsp; The exercise which the first
time required fifteen minutes to translate, the fifth time will
probably take but three.</p>
<p>A chief difficulty being the education of the ear, and the
time spent with the teacher being the pupil&rsquo;s best
opportunity for this, the lesson for the pupil so far as possible
should be aural, the exercises being spoken by the teacher to the
pupil for translation and the pupil&rsquo;s translations likewise
being spoken.&nbsp; The pupil&rsquo;s book should be kept closed
during the translation.</p>
<p>Supposing the pupil to be studying French.&nbsp; The teacher
should first speak the French exercise in French, the pupil
translating each sentence as spoken, into English.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Then taking the English exercise, the teacher should
translate it aloud into French, the pupil retranslating each
sentence, when spoken, into English.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The teacher should then speak each sentence of the
English exercise in English; the pupil translating each sentence
in a distinct voice into French.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; The teacher should then translate aloud sentence by
sentence, the French exercise into English; the pupil
retranslating each sentence into French.</p>
<p>This will double the exercises, which are usually rather
scanty.&nbsp; As we see, this part of the lesson is for the pupil
exclusively aural and oral; he works through the ear and tongue
only, his book being kept closed.</p>
<p>In working alone at the preparation of his lesson, there is
the disadvantage for the ear, that, before the sound reaches it,
the eye has conveyed the meaning to the brain, but when working
<!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>with the teacher as above, this drawback is
obviated.&nbsp; The test is indeed a more severe one than actual
conversation would be.&nbsp; When conversing, the subject is
known, and the question suggests the reply; but with disconnected
sentences, no such help is forthcoming.</p>
<p>The pupil can much hasten his own progress by varying the
exercises, forming of them question and answer, changing tenses
and moods of verbs, varying them so far as he can trying how far
he can make conversation out of them.</p>
<p>This method has further the advantage of showing the pupil
plainly, week by week, the progress he is making and the remedy
being in his own hands, he becomes responsible for his own
failure.&nbsp; If he cannot translate freely and easily, when
with the teacher, he cannot expect later to speak freely and
naturally, when he comes to engage in actual conversation with
foreigners.&nbsp; His remedy is to translate his exercises alone,
until he can do so, as readily, as if they were English.&nbsp;
The shyness and diffidence that so frequently accompany first
attempts to converse are not experienced under this method.</p>
<p>One reason why pupils in conversation fail to understand
readily is because they do not know the verbs well; do not know
their grammar; a sentence does not convey to them at once a
definite meaning, and whilst engaged in puzzling out the meaning
of what has already been said they cannot give their undivided
attention to what their interlocutor is just saying.</p>
<p>I have described the manner in which on Mr. Wm. Rodger&rsquo;s
visit in March 1891, I was led to this method.&nbsp;
Theoretically it seemed to me sound, and after having since
tested it practically, I do not think its merit
exaggerated.&nbsp; In April last 1894, a French Grammar by Mr.
Paul Baume was brought under my notice.&nbsp; Mr. Baume
recommends a similar method between teacher and pupil, but omits
to state how the pupil can best prepare himself for it.&nbsp; Mr.
Baume, will, I think find the difficulties he mentions to
disappear, if the pupil prepare himself as I have
prescribed.&nbsp; I have never encountered such difficulties, and
attribute this to the fact, that I always recommend pupils to
prepare themselves by studying aloud.&nbsp; Mr. Baume says he has
practised his method with considerable success during twenty
years.&nbsp; I was not very much surprised at having been
partially anticipated by Mr. Baume, for, while error is infinite,
the truth is one; there can be only one straight line between two
points, and this seems to me the most direct, the straightest way
to the <i>simultaneous fourfold acquirement</i> of a
language.</p>
<p><!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>With a Grammar like that of Otto an expeditious mode of
learning words is desirable.&nbsp; Perhaps the quickest, is to
transcribe the words to be learnt, into parallel columns and
covering up each column in turn, to run down them ten or more
times.&nbsp; Whilst doing this the foreign words should always be
pronounced aloud.&nbsp; The transcription impresses the spelling
on the memory, and where the written alphabet differs from the
English affords valuable practice.&nbsp; Arminius Vambery thought
it a matter for congratulation when having begun by learning ten
words daily, he was able to reach sixty.&nbsp; The column of
twenty foreign words can be mastered in about one quarter of an
hour, and I have myself done over 200 at this rate on some days,
though I do not say they can be retained without repetition.</p>
<p>Lord Dufferin says that in a work of about 600 pages, there
will probably be three thousand words of which the meaning will
be unknown to the student.&nbsp; A list should be made of them,
and they can be conveniently mastered at the rate of forty daily
and thus all learnt in three months.&nbsp; With each successive
work, the process should be repeated, until it becomes
unnecessary.&nbsp; He adds that this has the advantage that, if
necessary, after a long interval, by preserving such lists, the
words can be relearnt with little trouble.</p>
<p>An able Swiss authority recommends the pupil to learn from
10,000 to 12,000 words of each language, dividing them into three
or four classes according to their usefulness or frequency of
occurrence.&nbsp; He recommends their periodical repetition.</p>
<p>Asher&rsquo;s German Correspondent and Booch-Arkossy in the
&ldquo;Eco de Madrid&rdquo; recommend the translation of a good
idiomatic work into English and its translation into the language
of the original, carefully comparing such retranslation with the
original and noting mistakes.&nbsp; With the teacher, such
translation may be made by word of mouth, the teacher translating
into English and the pupil retranslating each sentence when
uttered into the language of the original.</p>
<p>Another method is to read and translate some idiomatic foreign
work.&nbsp; At the end of the paragraph, the teacher forms
questions from each sentence, to which the pupil replies.&nbsp;
So soon as able, the pupil, in turn, questions.&nbsp; This is I
believe substantially the old &ldquo;Robertsonian
method.&rdquo;&nbsp; The pupil can prepare his lesson by framing
both question and answer himself.&nbsp; It is excellent
drill.</p>
<p>Good practice in speaking is also to be obtained by the
pupil&rsquo;s narrating to the teacher in the language of the
original, <!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>the contents of each paragraph.&nbsp;
He need not of course attempt to recite by heart the words of the
text, but merely repeat the sense.</p>
<p>Mr. Chardenal recommends the pupil to translate mentally an
increasing number of sentences daily and to repeat them as
frequently as possible during the day.&nbsp; The sentences should
illustrate important rules.&nbsp; His object is to induce mental
work, personal labour on the part of the pupil.</p>
<p>Arminius Vambery&rsquo;s method was to enter into imaginary
conversations with himself.</p>
<p>All these methods do not mean discordance but agreement.&nbsp;
All methods which concurrently with Grammar, mean practice or
induce it, are good.&nbsp; This is the pith and secret of all
successful systems: <i>practice with method</i> often, much, and
aloud but by all means master the Grammar as quickly and
thoroughly as possible, and thus practice strengthens grammar,
while grammar guides and illumines practice.</p>
<p>Dr. Abercrombie in his work, &ldquo;Intellectual Powers&rdquo;
chapter &ldquo;Memory,&rdquo; says the depth, the permanence of
an impression on the mind depends upon the distinctness of the
perception, the intensity with which it is contemplated, the
length of time during which it is kept before the mind, the
impression being very much strengthened by being repeatedly
brought before the mind.&nbsp; This labour must be a voluntary
act on the part of the individual.&nbsp; He adds: &ldquo;The
habit of listless activity should be carefully guarded against by
the young, and the utmost care should be taken to cultivate the
opposite, namely, of directing the mind intensely to whatever
comes before it in reading or observation.&nbsp; This may be
considered as forming the foundation of a sound intellectual
character.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lord Macaulay attributed his marvellous memory to a very
simple method, adopted when a boy.&nbsp; When reading, at the
bottom of each page, he required himself to give an account of
its contents.&nbsp; At the outset, said he, he needed to reperuse
the page three or four times, but he ended by being able almost
to recite a book from beginning to end after having once read it
through.&nbsp; This is also the essential feature recommended by
Dr. Abercrombie in his &ldquo;Intellectual Powers&rdquo; chapter
on memory.&nbsp; Such a method of summarising each letter, order,
invoice, or conversation at its close would also give good
results to the Merchant, Clerk, or Traveller, both in leaving a
clear impression and in strengthening the memory.</p>
<p>It certainly seems to me an excellent way for mastering the
<!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>rules, and would admit of their recapitulation each time
the exercises are gone through.</p>
<p>Reading aloud is also an excellent practice.&nbsp; It improves
the pronunciation and trains or keeps the ear in practice.&nbsp;
Its benefit is not to be measured by what is retained by the
memory.&nbsp; It confers also a benefit similar to that which is
derived from a course of arithmetic.&nbsp; Grammatical
peculiarities may be noted at the end of the book, and the page
added.&nbsp; As the limbs are invigorated and strengthened by
suitable exercise, so the powers of the mind are strengthened and
developed by following a great mind at its best, following its
train of thought, of reason.</p>
<p>Mr. John Cryer in his school board electioneering address,
1894, ranges promising pupils in the order of workers, plodders
and bright ones.&nbsp; The last are frequently overrated, the
memory more quick than retentive.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wie gewonnen, so
zerronnen,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lightly come, lightly go,&rdquo; mere
quickness may prove a will o&rsquo; the wisp, and may be peculiar
to one subject, but the capacity for patient, honest, painstaking
work is a vastly more valuable quality, which can be applied with
fair success to any pursuit.&nbsp; It gives earnest of the sense
of duty, of responsibility, and that capacity for self-sacrifice,
which peculiarly fit and qualify their possessor for positions of
trust and responsibility; it is a pledge that the amount of
labour will be forthcoming to render equal to the position.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Practice makes perfect&rdquo; says the proverb.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Habit becomes second nature&rdquo; and the facility and
aptitude which nature sometimes bestows as a free gift can be
acquired at the cost of application and diligence.</p>
<p>Whilst mastering the first language the pupil is also learning
how to learn languages, each successive one becomes more
easy.</p>
<p>Let the pupil make it a rule always to do his best.&nbsp; He
will naturally take a pride and a pleasure in work well done, and
by continually striving and studying to do better, he cannot fail
to improve in it.&nbsp; This is the road to honest success, to
happiness and to self-improvement: this will continually enlarge
his capabilities and strengthen his natural powers, and, even if
he fail in accomplishing all he aimed at, there can be no better
consolation than that of knowing that he has nothing to reproach
himself with that he has manfully done his best, and that he is
the better for the effort.</p>
<p>In their desire to disparage and discredit the already
existing system of learning Foreign Languages by means of a <!--
page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>Grammar, the exponents of the &ldquo;Natural
Method&rdquo; and &ldquo;Method of Nature&rdquo; choose to ignore
the existence of the large number of Linguists who have acquired
their knowledge through a Grammar.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gouin</span> is of opinion that one
can learn a language perfectly in 900 hours, or 300 lessons of
three hours each, one can know enough French to feel at home in
France, to understand what is said in street, cafe, or railway,
to read a French newspaper with ease and to talk French with a
French accent in six months lessons of 2 hours each, five days
per week&mdash;<i>see</i> &ldquo;<i>Review of Reviews</i>&rdquo;
1892, <i>page</i> 512, <i>and January</i>, 1893.</p>
<p>Most teachers under the Grammatical Method have to achieve
success or make the best of one lesson of one hour weekly.&nbsp;
This is one-fifteenth, or one-tenth of the time per week
mentioned by Mr. <span class="smcap">Gouin</span>.</p>
<p>The saving of time shown by the Grammatical Method is due to
generalisation.&nbsp; It distributes words into classes, defines
the laws or rules that govern their use, and regulates the
construction of sentences.&nbsp; Sentences are thus taught in
groups and not singly.&nbsp; The pupil learns to construct
sentences, and does not simply learn by heart to repeat
them.&nbsp; He can thus supply himself at will with an infinite
number.&nbsp; If he fail thus to apply his knowledge, only his
own lack of diligence is in fault.</p>
<p>The writer first commenced the study of languages nearly forty
years ago, and during this time he has spent nearly twenty years
abroad, in various foreign countries, but he never met with a
case where a pupil had continuously, daily, earnestly, and
honestly devoted one-fourth of the time mentioned by Mr. Gouin to
the study of a good grammar of a foreign language who could
reasonably complain of failure, nor indeed a shorter space of
time applied under the same conditions which did not meet with a
proportionate measure of success.</p>
<p>The titles of the new methods have been adroitly chosen, they
claim to be those of nature and by implication stigmatise the
Grammatical method as unnatural.&nbsp; They profess that they
teach a foreign language as a child learns to speak its mother
tongue.&nbsp; A very high classical authority coupled
&ldquo;ratio et oratio&rdquo; reason and speech as complements
and indubitably speech can only improve and develop as the mind
unfolds and matures.&nbsp; Those who adopt the new method appear
to think the limitations imposed by the immature child&rsquo;s
mind worthy of imitation when dealing with the riper adult.&nbsp;
Rule of Thumb has the advantage that being born of and acquired
by <!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>practice it can be applied and put into practice, but it
is certainly rather late in the day to revert to it in the
acquirement of languages.&nbsp; We have had some experience of
Rule of Thumb in this town.&nbsp; The Grammatical Methods of
teaching languages are those of teaching any science in a
thorough manner.&nbsp; They classify the various parts of speech
for the purpose of reducing them to rule, these are studied in
detail and the rule defines the conditions and limitations under
which they can be used in construction.&nbsp; This rule teaches
us how we can correctly form thousands of sentences on the model
of one, instead of regarding each as so many distinct
phenomena.&nbsp; One Grammarian, Lennie, 47th Ed., defines
Grammar as the art of speaking and writing the English Language
with propriety.&nbsp; I venture to say that in dealing with a
foreign language one cannot express one&rsquo;s self with
accuracy, nay one cannot be confident of expressing one&rsquo;s
own meaning at all without a grammatical knowledge of it.&nbsp;
But, of course, speech means practice, and no amount of theory
can become a substitute for this.</p>
<p>Mr. Gouin was a youthful unmarried student of Caen University
distinguished by a capacious but not very retentive memory.&nbsp;
He was sent by the Professors to attend lectures at Berlin
University and Hamburg and proceeded to master German.&nbsp; He
learnt the German Grammar in ten days.&nbsp; But being unable to
understand the lectures he learns the 1000 German roots in four
days, and again tries the lecture room with the same
ill-success.&nbsp; He then decided to learn the German Dictionary
by heart and did so in one month, but on again attending the
lecture room, he was still unable to understand.&nbsp; He passed
ten months in similar efforts and states that on one occasion he
attended the lectures for a whole week, without understanding a
single sentence.&nbsp; He subsequently states, that his previous
ten months work, so far from being useful to him in a new effort
was detrimental.&nbsp; He had a wrong pronunciation, and there
was not a single verb in the whole language to which he did not
attribute a meaning other than the true one.&nbsp; He had to
unlearn, then relearn.&nbsp; After ten months labours he returned
to France unsuccessful.&nbsp; Under a teacher&rsquo;s guidance,
with much less labour, he would have achieved an unqualified
success.</p>
<p>By observing a young nephew of four years he is led to his
present method.&nbsp; He returns to Germany, puts it into
practice, and is speedily and eminently successful.&nbsp; He
banishes Dictionary, Grammar, Roots, Ollendorf and Robertson.</p>
<p>Mr. Gouin appears to have thought that since a language is
<!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>made up of grammatical rules and words, it was only
necessary to commit them to memory to have mastered the
language.&nbsp; His mistake was that of the person who should
suppose that since strength is derived from food, the more food
he swallows the stronger he becomes.&nbsp; He exceeded his
capacity of mental digestion and assimilation.</p>
<p>Another cause of Mr. Gouin&rsquo;s failure was that of
supposing that a knowledge of the theory carries with it the
ability to practice.</p>
<p>Mr. Gouin states that his memory was in his eye not in his
ear, and that a month&rsquo;s interruption of his labours
proceeding from disease of sight brought on by overwork was
sufficient to efface from his memory Grammar, Dictionary all
previously learnt.&nbsp; Dicken&rsquo;s Yorkshire schoolmaster,
Mr. Squeers recognised that knowledge acquired, ought speedily to
be put into practice.&nbsp; Mr. Gouin would have found in Paris,
many young Frenchmen engaged in commercial pursuits who speak
Italian or Spanish or Portuguese, and even English or German,
well, who have never been in any country where these languages
are spoken.&nbsp; This was the case so far back as 1866.</p>
<p><i>Review of Reviews</i>, 1892, <i>page</i>
88.&mdash;Professor Blackie says that after five months in
Germany, he knew German as well as his mother tongue.&nbsp; He
attended Professor&rsquo;s lectures, took regular lessons in
German.&nbsp; He added to this the text-book used by Professor,
daily intercourse with students, and the constant reading of easy
German books.&nbsp; By this combination of social intercourse,
primary training of the ear, and secondary use of relative books
both in reading and writing, he spoke German like English in five
months.&nbsp; Memory depends upon force of original impression
and frequency of repetition.&nbsp; He says that at the University
pupils did not learn to speak Latin.&nbsp; A new professor came
who spoke it, made a speech in it, and called upon the pupils to
reply, Blackie was the only one who ventured to do so, and had
learnt by &ldquo;spouting&rdquo; Latin speeches of Cicero etc. in
his room.&nbsp; He used Italian vowels.</p>
<p>Dr. Hanes says it is impossible to learn a language by the
translation of disconnected sentences, referring to the usual
exercises of the Grammatical Methods, and by learning lists of
words.&nbsp; The sentences are only disconnected in that they do
not always form question and answer, but this the student can
easily and profitably remedy.&nbsp; Besides all speech is not
dialogue.&nbsp; <i>See page</i> 7.&nbsp; They are no more
disconnected than are so many soldiers of a regiment, moving at
the impulse of one mind, and marching to the attainment of one
object.&nbsp; The connection is that all <!-- page 14--><a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>the soldiers
act in unison in execution of the command of their
officers.&nbsp; The connection between the so-called disconnected
sentences is that they have been selected to illustrate and
inculcate the rule under study.&nbsp; This is the true connection
that unites and harmonises them all, that each leads the pupil
directly to the attainment of his object&mdash;the mastery of the
rule.&nbsp; The illusory connection of some insipid narrative is
only delusive.</p>
<p>What can a method be which, from the beginning excludes the
mother tongue of the pupil when he knows no other? it is
necessarily confined to dumb show and practice.&nbsp; It is no
more to be compared for thoroughness to the Grammatical Method
than would be instruction in weaving by a weaver, with the
instruction of Master of the Technical School in constructing a
piece.&nbsp; Doubtless a person can learn to weave a piece in a
Factory but no one will compare such an acquirement with the
course of instruction in manufacturing, in the construction of a
piece, imparted at the Technical School, under the guidance, of
Mr. Ashenhurst&rsquo;s text books.&nbsp; Grammar, in the study of
language is such a text book, it imparts order and method to the
study.</p>
<p>We have suffered from the divorce and the dissociation of
theory and practice.&nbsp; Until recently our universities, or
seats of learning, catered only for the aristocracy, the
land-owning class, and the clergy: science was neglected.&nbsp;
Originating in the natural advantages of an abundant supply of
easily-worked coal and iron, an extensive coast line, and a
favourable geographical situation, we had achieved an undeniable
pre-eminence in industry and manufactures, which was supported by
abundant cheap capital and a spirit of enterprise; it was backed
by workmen possessed of natural ability, and such skill as
practice and highly sub-divided labour can impart.&nbsp; All this
was found insufficient to enable us to hold our own, our
supremacy was passing away, and when the cause of our inability
to maintain it was investigated, our deficiency was declared to
be the lack of a systematised higher education.&nbsp; Public
Spirit founded our Technical Schools to supply the remedy and
they have been found effective.</p>
<p>Owing to the neglect of modern languages by our Universities
and a system of higher education which took no cognizance of
industrial needs we were amongst the most backward in this branch
of study, but when interest was aroused our grammars were largely
borrowed from our more successful competitors from those who
excelled as much in modern languages as we ourselves in
industry.&nbsp; They were often the work of foreign specialists
and experts they are the very instruments of success used by our
<!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>most successful rivals, how then can they be
inadequate?&nbsp; Translation has put us into possession of the
best works used by our foreign rivals, and if we are less
successful than they it is due as a Swiss correspondent of the
&ldquo;Manchester Guardian&rdquo; recently stated not to the
superior aptitude but the superior application of the
foreigner.&nbsp; He is less sensible to the attractions of
football and out-door sports or at least they are not of such an
all-absorbing irresistible temptation.&nbsp; With a mother tongue
compounded of the Teutonic and Romance languages, no other people
than the British enjoys such a natural facility for acquiring
both the German and French and their sister tongues.</p>
<p>In 1893 the Scotch Education Department issued a report to the
Lords of the Committee of Council on Education for Scotland, by
Professor Herbert A.&nbsp; Strong, L.L.D. on</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Methods of
teaching Modern Languages in Belgium</span>.</p>
<p>Belgium was selected as a field for investigation, says
Professor Strong, because, from force of circumstances it has
paid particular attention to this branch of instruction, the
necessity of learning modern languages being there felt, much
more strongly than in Britain.&nbsp; It is a small country,
thickly populated, with an extensive commerce, for which as well
as for its literature, it is compelled to look to countries
larger than itself.&nbsp; It embraces three languages within its
borders&mdash;Flemish, spoken by more than three millions;
Walloon by over two millions, and French the language of
literature and commerce.</p>
<p>In the Primary Schools, French, the language of their
Literature and Commerce is studied six years.&nbsp; Every child
must study one language besides its mother tongue.&nbsp; This is
compulsory.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
